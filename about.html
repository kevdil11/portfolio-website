                <h3>More on my Past</h3>
                <p>I graduated from college in 2013 from Engineering Design and Drafting Technologies. Over my experience in this field, I have spent the time specializing in structural designs, which has aided me in developing a critical mind for
                  design and the skills for creating visually appealing drawings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I wanted to expand my experience into other design fields, so I looked into professions that I could lend my already developed skills to. I discovered UI design and found that I enjoyed this field of design. In February 2021, I
                  began my journey in learning about UI design through the online Careerfoudry course.

                <h3>Why do you think having<br>frontend skills is<br>valuable for a designer?</h3>
                <p>I have always been an advocate for understanding more about the complex interreacting components that goes into a well designed system. To be a great designer, it's essential to understand the other design disciplines that directly
                  interact with the components that I will be heavily involved with. With frontend skills, I can produce UI designs that will better suit the tasks that frontend developers have to implement into the product and reduce time and
                  frustrations in the overall design experience. I always think that team work is essential in order to streamline the design process of a product, so the more I know about the process of other design disciplines helps me be a better
                  team player for others!
